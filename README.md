## 1.1  Credit for this template
This template was not created by me (Neil Cook) though I added some functionality,
commands and a lot of the comments, including this “readme”. This template was
passed on to me by Dr. Federico Marocco and was originally created by Dr. Kieran
Forde (2007) and in various forms have been used by many of the astrophysics PhD
students at the University of Hertfordshire.
