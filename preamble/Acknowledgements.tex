This template was not created by me (Neil Cook) though I added some functionality, commands and a lot of the comments, including this ``readme''. This template was passed on to me by Dr. Federico Marocco and was originally created by Dr. Kieran Forde (2007) and in various forms have been used by many of the astrophysics PhD students at the University of Hertfordshire.
