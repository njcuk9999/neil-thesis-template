LaTeX Package : mfirstuc v2.02

Last Modified : 2015-12-17

Author        : Nicola Talbot

This package provides \makefirstuc{<stuff>} which makes the first object of
<stuff> upper case unless <stuff> starts with a control
sequence followed by a non-empty group, in which case the first
object in the group is converted to upper case. Examples:

     \makefirstuc{abc}        -> Abc
     \makefirstuc{\emph{abc}} -> \emph{Abc}
     \makefirstuc{{\'a}bc}    -> \'Abc
     \makefirstuc{\ae bc}     -> \AE bc
     \makefirstuc{{\ae}bc}    -> \AE bc
     \makefirstuc{\ae{}bc}    -> \AE{}bc

The package also provides \capitalisewords{<phrase>} which applies
\makefirstuc to each word in the <phrase>, where the words are
separated by regular spaces. (Exceptions can be made for words that
shouldn't be converted.)

The mfirstuc package was originally bundled with the glossaries
package.

LaTeX2HTML

This package comes with a LaTeX2HTML style file mfirstuc.perl which
should be placed in the relevant LaTeX2HTML styles directory, but
note that some commands may not be implemented or may be implemented
in a different way.
